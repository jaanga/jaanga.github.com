_GitHub API User Explorer2_

***



## Concept

GitHub has millions of project. With so many projects, finding projects that interest you is not easy. 

Finding projects with code you can use is not easy.

And then when you are notified about a GitHub user of interest, it's not that easy to explore their work.

There may be many repositories. There may be a lot of material that looks interesting but has not been updated in years.

Then there is the other side of the coin:

How can you make your own work more visible to the world?

How can visitors to your GitHb projects become informed in a speedy, fun manner about all the things you are doing.

Certainly the [Explore GitHub]( https://github.com/explore ) page is a good place to start. 

And there are a number of really interesting curation efforts.

And none of that stops you or us from investigating even more ways of exploring GitHub.

And, of course, GitHuB supplies a quite amazing tool for finding stuff on GitHub.

The GitHub developers API provides fast, free and easy access to millions of GitHub projects.

Therefore the idea is to build tols to help you snoop around GitHub and finds the things that are of particular interest to you.
