The Open Design School is one of the pillar projects of Matera 2019. It is a living lab for interdisciplinary experimentation, a platform that will be the main feature of Matera 2019 cultural programme. Its main goal is to produce the infrastructure necessary for Matera 2019. The Open Design School is not a school. It will serve as an instrument of systemic, community-wide capacity building where learning occurs through doing, prototyping and testing, in a continuous creative exchange process between art, science, and technology. It is a horizontal platform, a place of interdisciplinary learning and experimentation without strict hierarchies in which everyone learns from everyone, in an atmosphere of mutual enrichment."}
