What you see is the actual model (check out the 3D view). These LEGO components are the building blocks for building blocks. Too many large LEGO models are unable to fit in the warehouse, because of large file size (over 10MB). Now with blocks broken down into micro-components, you can fit double, quadruple or better the number of LEGOs, for larger sets, bigger models and more play-time. I doubt that there is a LEGO set which would not fit in the warehouse, using these pieces. These very accurate blocks have detailed undersides, simplified geometries and even the logos in the appropriate places. It is difficult to believe that they use less file space, I know! More unique pieces coming soon, for infinite possibilities. You can see an example model (6 wheeled crane from Technic designers idea book #8891) that I have begun to assemble and color. (Still at 10x or 10:1 scale) Please leave a rating if you are wowed by how small the file size is."}
