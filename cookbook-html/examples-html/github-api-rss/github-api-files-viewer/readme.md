[GitHub API File Viewer Read Me ]( #readme.md )
===

Given user, repo, folder and branch, find all files of HTML or MD
Display names in menu
Open and display nicely when called

Selected parameters are stored in an array in the file.
Easy to add new destinations

Menu - hamburger style - on right because most of my scripts have their title on the left


## To Do / Wish List

* View source code
* Open in new tab
* Highlight selected item on menu
* Add many more destinations - including third parties such as as Three.js and Tony Parisi
* Select way of viewing: menu, single page or gallery
* Show recent events
* Show blog posts
* Show page or readme thumbnails?!?
