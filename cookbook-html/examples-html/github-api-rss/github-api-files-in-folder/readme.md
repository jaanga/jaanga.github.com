## [github-api-files-in-folder]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-html/examples/github-api-rss/github-api-files-in-folder/ )


## Concept

GitHub repositories may contain hundreds of script files and spporting pages of content

GitHub enables inspection and hosting via its GitHub pages feature

Making this work available as web pages takes time and effort away from programming and documenting.

The GitHub tools for setting up a content management system (CMS) are require the use and knowledge of Ruby

Setting up a remote server to set up a content management system for GitHub files takes time, effort and money 

A possible alternative is to have a client-side JavaScript app to act as a CMS


### Mission

### Vision 

* TBD

* Request details of all files in a gh-pages branch of a GitHub repository.
* Create a file explorer with menu.
