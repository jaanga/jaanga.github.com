		"Anyway, we have had a singular dilemma here inside Burning mAnalemma.",
		"How do you take all the perfectly good music played on the Playa,",
		"And turn it into a palatable gumbo of street noises?",
		"Well, today, the manna from heaven arrived. Or maybe it was just the heat.",
		"Burning mAnalemma has reinvented the so-called 'radio buttons' just for you.",
		"The Playa is alive with the sound of sex, drugs and Rock and Roll.",
		"Um, my humble apologies, I meant to say sound of music.",
		"And so now you can be a Playa DJ too!",
