## Concept

A web worker is a JavaScript script executed from an HTML page that runs in the background, independently of user-interface scripts that may also have been executed from the same HTML page. Web workers are often able to utilize multi-core CPUs more effectively.

Features

* Web workers interact with the main document via message passing.
