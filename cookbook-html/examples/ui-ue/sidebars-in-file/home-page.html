				'</p>The purpose of this demo is to focus on the disposition of different typs in information in an app as well as its behavior. </p>' +
				'<p>This demo is <b>*not*</b> about content, appearance or style. So issues of fonts, sizes, styles, colors, exact placement, alignmnts are not the issue here.</p> ' +
				'<p>The important things are: </p>' +
				'<ul>' +
					'<li>the three boxes</li>' +
					'<li>The kind or type of information they display</li>' +
					'<li>The ease with which the boxes may be manipulated</li>' +

				'<p>Do the boxes open and close as they should? Might there be a better way?</p> ' +
				'<p>Does this box scroll properly? What happends hen you resize the window or reload the app? </p>' +
				'<h2>BTW</h2>' +
				'<p>If you look at the code you will see that it\'s nearly 100% JavaScript. There\'s no separate style sheet and just the minimum HTML to load the page.</p>' +
				'<p>Writing text as if it were code helps remind you that it\'s all code/objects/strings just waiting to be manipulated.</p>' +
				'<p>The layout of the code is generous horizontally and greedy vertically. One day monitors will be easier to rotate and it will be logical to be generous in both directions.</p>' +
				'<p>All this to say, apart from the disposition and the behavios, the code itself is open for discssion in a demo like this...</p>' +
