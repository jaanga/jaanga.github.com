## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

Arthur C Clarke's Three Laws number three states: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

Web pages are a good example of this phenomenon. Most people have not a clue as to how what they see on the screen has been created, stored and transmitted.
 
### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To show that a web page is made from code

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help more people become interested in coding in order to help get things done
