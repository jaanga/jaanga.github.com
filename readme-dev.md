## Note

In most (all other?) instances the read me document of a Jaanga repository is also its home page when viewed using the GitHub [Pages]( https://pages.github.com/ ) feature.

This read me does not follow the typical example.

There have been so many fun updates to the Jaanga home page that we decided to keep them all in their [Jaanga Home Page]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/home ) folder.

Therefore the [index.html]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/blob/master/index.html ) file - that would normally link to this read me file is set 
to punt to the latest revision in the home folder. And this read me file is kind of bogus - and the material below is archaic.

All this confuses us too!


## System Requirements

In order to view the files on this site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/).
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Generally this means a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. 
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.
 
The apps here are currently being built and tested with the Google Chrome browser. 
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such time as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.
