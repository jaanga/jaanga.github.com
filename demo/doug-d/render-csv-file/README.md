> This is great.  to make it a bit more artistic could we make white lines on a black background and maybe a tad thicker?  also if its possible to make the lines transparent that helps too.

> It works [the OBJ file renderer], but  but can you work with “line files”.  I think they have a more ”different “ look then the object files.
