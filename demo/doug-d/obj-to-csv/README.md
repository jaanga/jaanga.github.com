<summary>Concept</summary>

Load and view OBJ files in 3D. Generate contour lines. Export vertices to CSV files.

### Features

- Load and view OBJ files in 3D
	- Scale and center geometry
	- Combine multiple geometries into one
- Update mesh
	- Rotate around XYZ
	- Select material
	- Update opacity
	- Toggle edges, box helper and wireframe
- Generate contour lines
	- Choose one to many
	- Select elevation of a single contour line
	- Menu displays a number of stats
	- Toggle view of mesh, contours and points
- Export vertices to CSV files
	- Export as strings of vertices
	- XYZ coordinates plus a line index
- Display settings
	- Update a variety of scene display settings

### Mission

- To be able to create contours for any OBJ file
- To be able to generate contours for any 3D file (STL etc ) or parametric

### Vision

- Augment 3D so as to supply it with even greater dimensionality

### Versions

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.03 ]( v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html )

- Add 'Remove short segments' button
	- Button must be pushed in order to intiate a second pass on the data
	- Does better job of finding and deleting
	- Provides report on how many segments deleted
- Add contour line labels checkbox toggle
	- Will help with identifying and reporting contours with issues
- Add contours are drawn in real-time as they are being calculated
	- Makes for a more attractive user experience


[OBJ to CSV 0.06.02 ]( v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html )

2019-12-12

- Deletes segments of three vertices or less that are all very close together
- Add if last vertex is close to first vertex then close the polygon
- Update the statistics display

[OBJ to CSV 0.06.01 ]( v-0-06/obj-to-csv.html )

2019-12-11

- Looking OK
- Too many new things to list

[OBJ to CSV 0.05.00 ]( v-0-05/obj-to-csv.html )

* Mostly broken
* Gets Uncaught RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded



[OBJ to CSV 0.04.02 ]( v-0-04/obj-to-csv.html )

2019-12-07

* Add link to Render CSV file
* When ask for 72 contour levels you now get 72 contour levels (but each contour may have multiple lines)
* Export CSV segments dropped


[OBJ to CSV 0.04.00 ]( v-0-04/obj-to-csv.html )

2019-12-06

* Exported contours beginning to look good


[OBJ to CSV 0.03 ]( v-0-03/obj-to-csv-01.html )

* Keep hacking at better contours

[OBJ to CSV 0.02 ]( v-0-02/get-contours-from-objects.html )

* Keep hacking at better contours

[OBJ to CSV 0.01 ]( v-0-01/get-contours-from-objects.html )

* Adds export to segments
* Mesh material settings
* Add contour points toggles


[OBJ to CSV 0.00 ]( v-0-00/get-contours-from-objects.html )

* Complete remake of group-points-of-intersection
* Code split up into modules



#### [group-points-of-intersection read me]( https://jaanga.github.io/demo/doug-d/obj-to-csv/group-points-of-intersection/readme.html )

* Covers the details and links to five earlier releases
* Includes the file from Paul West that that inspired

<summary>Issues </summary>

- 2019-12-11 ~ Theo ~ Some extra lines are drawn
- 2019-12-11 ~ Theo ~ Some gaps appear in contours
- 2019-12-11 ~ Theo ~ Some contour lines are drawn as multiple line segments instead of one

<summary>To do and wish list </summary>

* 2019-12-11 ~ Theo ~ Add some memoization to main contour generating routine
* 2019-12-03 ~ Theo ~ Add [decimate function]( https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_modifier_simplifier.html ) to reduce number of faces to inspected
* 2019-12-01 ~ Theo ~ Scale along three axis not just Z
* 2019-12-01 ~ Theo ~ Animate the generation of points to do away with long pauses
* 2019-12-01 ~ Theo ~ Better use of original materials in OBJ file
