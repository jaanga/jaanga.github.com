_IFC View R1_

***


## Concept

* IFC is an emerging AEC standard
* Many apps are proprietary and closed source
* Most of the open source apps require a download and install
* Mobile apps seem almost non-existent

_qll of the above needs confirming_

### Mission

* Build lightweight IFC apps that work in your browser
* Provide interactive 3D views
* Entry level code accessible by engineers and architects


### Vision

*

## Features

* Choose from three examples
* Click three bars( 'hamburger' ) icon to slide menu in or out
* Direct link to this read me file
* Click on title to reload


## Things you can do using this script


* Click the three bars( 'hamburger menu icon' ) to slide the menu in and out
* Press Control-U/Command-Option-U to view the source code
* Press Control-Shift-J/Command-Option-J to see if the JavaScript console reports any errors


<!--
## Things you can do by editing the code

* Open this file: https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/cookbook-html/demo/ifc/index.html
* Click the 'Raw' icon and save the raw file to your computer
* Once you've downloaded the file, you can click it to run it.
* Open the file with a text editor

## Change Log

### 2016-11-07 ~ R1

* Opens, reads, parses and displays IFC files
* Three examples
    * Hello Wall
        * [Building Smart - Examples]( http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/implementation/ifc4-implementation/helpful-examples )
    * Hello House
        * Still at very early stage of interpretation - date held in library blocks needs extrusion, position and rotation
        * [Building Smart - Examples]( http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/implementation/ifc4-implementation/helpful-examples )
    * rst_advanced_sample_project.ifc
        * 15K entities - takes a while to load
* Reads and displays in 3D polylines, polyloops and coordinates
* Reads and displays on menu some unformatted project meta-data
* First commit
* Add Read Me
