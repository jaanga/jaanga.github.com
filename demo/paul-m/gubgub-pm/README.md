_A custom GubGub for Paul M_

## Full screen [GubGub Paul M]( http://jaanga.github.io/demo/paul-m/gubgub-pm/ )

### 2016-10-29 Questions

* What features need to be added or subtracted to make this script useful to you?
* Are there some good queries or favorites that should be added?
* Are there any aspects that need simplifying or clarifying

### Notes

This version of GubGub is not intended for use on the small screen of a mobile phone.

See Change Log of main README for current test results

This version is the 'Kitchen Sink' script. It tries to play with everything/anything.
Future revisions will explore the building of much simpler tools.
