## Concept

### Mission

## Issues

* Tested on Chrome and Firefox only
* Button working on Android phone, though working on Android tablet
* Not a good voice on Chromebooks


## To Do

* Read content data from CSV or Gist file
* Save presentation as WebM video
* Ability Embed and control Three.js scenes
 

## Users

Intended for 

* Small groups of collaborators where one or more members know a bit about programming
* People who want to work with FOSS tools
* People looking to create presentations out of the scope of what is possible with apps such as PowerPoint and KeyNote
