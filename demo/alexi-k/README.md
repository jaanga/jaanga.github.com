_Timber Frame in EarthQuake_

***


## Concept

### The Problem

Before they buy a new technology, people want to see the technology work for themselves. The want to be able to experiment, test and analyze what it's doing.

Reading papers, viewing videos, listening to experts helps but does not convince.

You want to be able to see, touch and manipulate a working version of the technology


### Solution

The technology in question is about the timber fasteners to help building structures survive earthquakes in simpler more reloable ways than current technology.

Therefore any good demo of the technology will have to simulate the characteristics of an earthquake. The solution in this demo is based on the concept of placing a scaled - or even full size - model of the frame of a platform suspended by cables from a ceiling. This would be very similar to sitting on a child's swing. The demo would involve pulling the platform to a suitable height, letting go and having the platform strike a fixed object at the bottom of the swing while moving at maximum speed. It is like that a weight would be necessary to simulate the load places on the frame. The load could be simulated by a box full of jugs filled with water.

### Mission

* A mathematically accurate demo
* showing the platform being lifted to a selected height
* hitting an obstruction
* Deformation and breaking as appropriate
