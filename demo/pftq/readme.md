## Concept

### Issues / Problems

<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

* Assembly manuals are frequently PDF files with twenty pages or more. Do we really have to download and print them out?
* Assembly manuals need to display text in many languages.
* Assembly manuals must be accessible to people who have difficulty reading text.
* Even with all the drawings there are frequently still places you can't see
* The furniture is 3D but the manuals are only 3D


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* Build many very small scripts - each with different features
* Eventually decide which features to keep and which to discard
* Much easier than trying to build one big app all at once


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To create manuals that are fun


## Things to Do / Road Map

### Coming up next

* Front page with text warnings and advice in images
* The screw driver
* The animated assembly sequence for a large object
	* Can you see everything even on a phone screen?

### Animation series

* Issue: Reset counter to start with each new replay
* Issue: prevent multiple replays from going on at the same time
* Make time between animation frames adjustable
* Animate multiple pegs/screws moving at once
 

### Kallax

* Set up so works on phone very nicely
* Add real colors
* Add accessories, coordinated products and links to buy
* Add typical things that go on bookcases
* Add room and people and zombies
* Add more realistic screws and pegs
* Show demo functioning in an iframe
* Add animation where components fly in one by one in order 
* Add color coding - next item to be installed is highlighted red
* Export as STL file for use in CAD program
* Add exploded view
* Add more fun and lively things 

## Features

* Zoom, pan and rotate
	* 1 finger / left button =  rotate
	* 2 finger / wheel = zoom in and out
	* 3 finger / right button = pan

## Issues

### Kallax

* Shown in upright position, but should in on ground while being built position
* Shown with screws on top, but they should be on side
* Show with screws partially screwed in. Need better ways of showing final position
* Still missing a number of screw holes
* Still missing wall brackets
