One of our favorite quotes is: 'This is not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.'
It's a [quote from Winston Churchill]( https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill#The_Second_World_War_ ) made midway during the Second World War.

With reference to the Outer Space project it is say that a good body of work has been accomplished, but there is much more to do.
We begin to have an idea of the issues but don't exactly know where it all leads to.

We have learned so many things:

* GitHub enables you to put large amounts of data on line - up to a gigabyte per repository - with no fees
* The GitHub Pages feature allows users to access that data from their browsers in a timely fashion
* Playing with huge binary files is made kind of being made easy with JavaScript and node.js
* Gazetteers with many thousands of locations can be turned into items in 3D with few issues
* Moving a million 3D vertexes in real-time is doable - even on your phone
* The ways research and scientific organizations keep their data can be really old-timey. Freeing up that data can be fun

The main thing is that we a basis of simple, easy to modify code that could be used to create a wide variety of visualizations.
For example, have a look at the many ways the Moon Voyager Gamer code has been re-mashed to satisfy a variety of needs.


Even with all this work, the bulk of te work is in the future. For the time being there is no math.
There are no orbits or trajectories bing calculated.
And there is no indication as to the optics and sensors used to capture the data we have. But one day will recreate Galileo's telescope and look through it and see how he say the Moon and Mars.
We will recreate the trajectories of the heavenly bpdies according to Kepler's rules and to all the subsequent enhancements.

Here is another quote: The best is yet to be.
