[Blog App Update]( https://jaanga.github.io/outer-space/blog/index.html#2015-10-24_blog-app-update_blog.md )

The Outer Space blogging script is coming along nicely. It's easy to use and easy to enhance and only a few lines of code.

Today a button to get to the source code on GitHub has been added as well as the [Read Me]( https://github.com/jaanga/jaanga.github.io/tree/master/outer-space/blog ) being filled out.

There may be issues with posts not appearing in correct date order - due to JavaScript loading files asynchronously.
We are looking into this and trying to figure out a really simple way to ensure correct order.

There's a good chance that this whole blogging script project can stay quite simple.
After all to look at the history, all you have to do is go to GitHub.
