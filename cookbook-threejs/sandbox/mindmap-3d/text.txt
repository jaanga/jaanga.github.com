OpenStudio is an open source (LGPL) project to facilitate community development, extension, and private sector adoption. OpenStudio includes graphical interfaces along with a Software Development Kit (SDK).<br /><br />
										The graphical applications include the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in, OpenStudio Application, ResultsViewer and the Parametric Analysis Tool. The OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in is an extension to Trimble's popular SketchUp 3D modeling tool that allows users to quickly create geometry needed for EnergyPlus. Additionally, OpenStudio supports import of gbXML and IFC for geometry creation. The OpenStudio Application is a fully featured graphical interface to OpenStudio models including envelope, loads, schedules, and HVAC. ResultsViewer enables browsing, plotting, and comparing simulation output data, especially time series. The Parametric Analysis Tool enables studying the impact of applying multiple combinations of OpenStudio Measures to a base model as well as export of the analysis results for EDAPT submission.<br /><br />
										In addition to the graphical interface, OpenStudio allows building researchers and software developers to quickly get started through its multiple entry levels, including access through C++, Ruby, and C#. Users can leverage the Ruby interface to create OpenStudio Measures that can be easily shared and applied to OpenStudio Models. <a href="https://www.openstudio.net/">Visit Website</a>

                                        Sankom Sp. z o.o is a company out of Warsaw, Poland. It
                                        develops and publishes software supporting the process of sanitary systems design.

                                        is a desktop software tool and Autodesk Revit plug-in. The Revit plug-in extends the
                                        capabilities of a standard Revit building block export to gbXML.
                                       For example, Revit does not always export building materials that correctly define heat parameters.
                                        In this case, the layers that are exported to gbXML are not defined in the material layer.

                                        The gbXML Auditor plug-in eliminates this problem.

                                        Win_Ht is a calculation program focused on calculations for Swiss standards
                                        - e.g. SIA Norms.<br /><br />

                                        Win_Ht Version 3.11 - release date September 30th, 2016 - will import versions 5.0 to 6.01 of gbXML.

                                        Imported data can be used to calculate heating loads,
                                        underfloor heating, radiators, system redundancy, thermal energy, heat transmission and more.

GBIS enhances the gbXML file with internal CAD data. This allows for a very detailed building model and error checking. SOLAR-COMPUTER building programs can also import gbXML files directly. <a href="http://www.solar-computer.co.uk/index.php?seite=demonstration&sub=video">Visit Website</a></div>
