Constructive Solid Geometry Read Me
===

[CSG Basic R1]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/examples/geometry/constructive-solid-geometry/csg-basic-r1.html )

* Based on Chandler Prall's latest code
* Shows his examples and two more




[Constructive solid geometry R1]( http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook-threejs/examples/geometry/constructive-solid-geometry/constructive-solid-geometry-r1.html )

* Click any of the six buttons to generate the examples
* Demonstrations of moderately complex Boolean operations. A work in progress
* Also needs examples showing more basic, simpler operations
	* As well as intersection examples
* Requires a computer that can do some heavy lifting
	* Be prepared to wait for twenty second and more for model to be generated
* Best to reload the page in between drawing each object
