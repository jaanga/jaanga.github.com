## Full Screen: [Load Texture Video]( https://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/examples/xxxxxx/xxxxxx.html )
-->


## Concept

Three.js shapes and meshes display quite different behaviors when video textures are supplied as materials.

With meshes

* All meshes display the entire video
* Videos are scaled to fit edge to edge

With shapes
* Life seems to be more interesting
* The origing of th video is in global space not entity local coordinates
* Shade and wholes do not change the scale
