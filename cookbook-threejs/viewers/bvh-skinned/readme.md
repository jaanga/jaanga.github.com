[Skinned BVH](http://jaanga.github.io/cookbook/bvh-skinned/latest/ )


### Mission
To create fully skinned character animations such that the skins move with a natural appearance with any any and all underlying BVH motion capture files
 
### Notes
This project is very much a work in progress. It is perhaps the most complicated of all projects in the cookbook.
And it may eventually have the most far reaching consequences.

This project is very much linked to similar work with the Leap Motion device.
