<summary>Concept</summary>

If you want to get on the web, there are a ton of fast, free and easy ways to do so. Good examples include the following.

* If you want to write: [medium]( https://medium.com)
* If you want to sell: [shopify]( https://www.shopify.com/ ), [squarespace]( https://squarespace.com)
* If you want to blog: [wordpress]( https://wordpress.com ), [blogger]( https://www.blogger.com/ )
* If you want to do a bunch of things: [weebly]( https://www.weebly.com/ ), [wix]( https://www.wix.com/ )

But what if none of these are exactly what you are looking for? What if you just want to learn to make your own web presence from scratch by yourself?

And, let's say you are not going to build something for a big bank and have little interest in being a "[full stack developer]( https://skillcrush.com/2017/02/27/front-end-back-end-full-stack/ )" and - as much as you like the web - there are other things you do that are more important than programming.

Well, you have come to the right place. This page is about building stuff for the web using the equivalent of pliers, hammers and screwdrivers. It's about getting your web feet wet without drowning. It's about showing you how to be dangerous but without hurting anything.

The steps will be something like this.

* Learn about HTML, CSS and JavaScript using freecodecamp
* Learn how tp get help from the sources below
* Getting some web pages built and hosted in GitHub

But the actual steps depend on what you want to do.

So get in touch and let's do it!
