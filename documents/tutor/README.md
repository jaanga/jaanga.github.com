# Tutor Read Me


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qSn_HibbOF-giNUv9OHf4eeUSo9rU2bRSTATQEL8Y0M/edit



Thank you for considering that tutelage from an old poop like me might be a gainful experience.

Current Level of Understanding
Much about mastering something technical is simply about being comfortable with the vocabulary.

Can you listen to or read about a technical topic and feeling lost, overwhelmed or just being bored is a rare thing?

So let's start with looking at on online document that covers the Internet and being a techie.

www.20thingsilearned.com

This is roughly a sixty page document. Please try to just skim through it.  Fingers crossed you know, or have some understanding of, say, 80% or more of the content. All we want to know about are the places that you skimmed that covered unfamiliar topics. This should takes twenty to thirty minutes at most.

All we want to do now is to get ready for the course by seeing if you have acquired most of the prerequisites.

Once the skimming is complete, could you respond to these questions?

Did this document provide some kind of enjoyable or useful experience?
	* Not fun material must be dropped from our course ASAP
Was it appropriate at this point?
	* Or should we start from a different point of view?
Was there anything in this document that you feel we should cover as we progress with the course?
	If so, can you list terms we could look at in more depth?


What Problem Are We Trying to Solve?
Establishing a mission or vision for what we want to do with this course will take a while, but we should also *start* to pinpoint the problems we are trying to solve.

Here is a typical problem:

* I look at a web page and I see a problem, but I don't know who or what to blame for the issue

Can you think of and describe some problems that you feel need solving?


Effective Use of Time and Effort
My goal is that what I've asked for may be accomplished in less than 45 minutes and require more than a few hundred words. Fingers crossed.


I look forward to hearing your thoughts. Anything - including the wording of this message, pedagogical method and syllabus outline - is open for your guidance

Theo
