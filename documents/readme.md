## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Acquiring a good education takes forever, but that shouldn't stop you from learning.


### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To supply a number of guides to sources you can use to help learn aspects of [STEM]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_Technology,_Engineering,_and_Mathematics ).
* Provide easy ways to view/browse lots of original source documents very quickly 
	* You don't go to the documents, the documents come to you
	* Like radio buttons
	* Like changing TV channels
* Everything is FOSS forkable
	* Very open licenses
	* Very easy to access, mash-up, re-appropriate, whatever

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To supply a fast way of learning a skill is by looking at an example, editing it and coming up with something new
* Provide just-in-time learning for a variety of STEM topics
	* Just what you need to know to complete the next action in your project


## Things to Do / Road Map
This document viewer is a an early stage work-in-progress. 
There is much to fix with regards to displaying the data inside an iframe.

* Center the documents in the window


<!--
## Features
